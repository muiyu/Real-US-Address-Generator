# Real US Address Generator

***Please do not use this project for illegal purposes!***

This is a simple web application that generates random real US addresses, names, genders, and phone numbers. You can also specify a state to generate addresses from that particular state.

**This repo is a fork from the [origin repo](https://github.com/chatgptuk/Real-US-Address-Generator), and it allows you to run with Node.js instead of Cloudflare Workers.**

By the way, use this repo on Docker is what I really love. You know, as a Perfectionism, I really work on closing off env!

*I just be crazy for configing the development env for my DataScience courses.*
